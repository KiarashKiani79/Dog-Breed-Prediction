# <font color="yellow"> Dog Breed Prediction Project üê∂ </font>

## Overview
This project involves using Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can identify dog breeds from images.

## Steps

1. **Data Loading**
   - Connect to Google Colab.
   - Load data from Kaggle, including images and their corresponding breed labels.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Perform one-hot encoding on labels.
   - Convert and normalize images.

3. **Model Building**
   - Check the shape and size of the data.
   - Build the CNN architecture.

4. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Split the data.
   - Train the model.
   - Create accuracy plots.
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy.

5. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to predict dog breeds.

## Applications
- The CNN model can be optimized further.
- Practical applications for NGOs and educational purposes in animal care.
